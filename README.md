# Subscription Tracker

According to the Washington Post, the subscription market is worth around $750B in 2021 and is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2025. The pace at which the market is expanding has made it very difficult for the Federal Trade Commission to regulate. In search of a free and fair market, the idea of Subscription Tracker came to be. Our app will provide weekly, monthly, and yearly reminders according to your subscription. It will also give you a clear and informative display of each dollar amount, so you know exactly where your money is going at all times, allowing you to balance your budget where needed. Let those frustrating times of seeing an unexpected charge in your bank account because of a forgotten subscription be a thing of the past.
